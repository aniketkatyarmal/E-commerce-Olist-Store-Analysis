E-commerce Olist Store Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of an online store using a dataset from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace. The goal is to derive actionable insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and overall business health using various data analysis tools.

Project Overview
Olist provides a comprehensive dataset that includes information on orders, customers, payments, reviews, products, and more. In this project, we perform an in-depth analysis to understand the key metrics that drive the success of an e-commerce platform.

Tools Used
SQL: Employed for data extraction, transformation, and aggregation. Complex queries were written to join multiple tables, filter datasets, and calculate essential metrics such as average order value, repeat customer rate, and sales performance over time.

Excel: Used for initial data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Key performance indicators (KPIs) were calculated to identify trends and anomalies in sales, returns, and customer satisfaction.

Power BI: Utilized to create interactive dashboards for visualizing sales trends, customer demographics, and other crucial KPIs. The dashboards provide a dynamic view of data, allowing for deeper insights into customer behavior and business performance.

Tableau: Leveraged for advanced data visualization and storytelling. Tableau's interactive features enabled the creation of compelling visual narratives to highlight key findings and support data-driven decision-making.

Key Insights
Customer Segmentation: Identified different customer segments based on purchasing behavior, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.

Sales Performance: Analyzed sales data to uncover peak sales periods, product performance, and revenue trends, facilitating better inventory and marketing planning.

Customer Retention: Investigated repeat purchase rates and customer satisfaction to recommend strategies for improving customer loyalty.
